Task Tracker Application

This Task Tracker is a simple web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this application is to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can add new tasks using an input box, view all added tasks in a list format, and mark tasks as completed once they are done.

The application provides a clean and modern user interface where each task shows its current status as either Pending or Completed. This makes it easy for users to track their progress. The Task Tracker demonstrates basic frontend development concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive UI design.
